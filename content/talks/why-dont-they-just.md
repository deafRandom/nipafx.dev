There are many nifty features that Java could have but doesn't.
Why, though, how hard can it be to implement them?
Why don't they just...

* let us add fields to records?
* add `?.` for null-safe member selection?
* add extension methods?
* remove the need for semicolons?
* introduce immutable collections?
* make `Stream` handle exceptions?
* turn `Optional` into a proper monad?

After this talk, you'll know.
And have gained insight into the deliberations behind the decisions that evolve Java and why nothing can "just" be implemented.
