Some projects are still on Java 8, many on 11 and yet, Java 17 is already out!
Java's recent releases have a lot in stock - in this talk you'll learn about...

* new language features like sealed types, pattern matching, records, switch expressions, and more
* the additions to existing APIs, like `Stream` and `Optional`
* other niceties like multi-release JARs and performance improvements

After this talk you will be prepared to get started with Java 17.
