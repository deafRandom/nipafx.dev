I may be biased (given I'm its creator), but I think [JUnit Pioneer](https://junit-pioneer.org) is a pretty cool project. ðŸ˜Š
So I was delighted when [Global Summit for Java devs](https://java.geekle.us/) offered me an opportunity to give a talk on it and I could even invite other maintainers to co-present.
Our slot was only 40 minutes, though, which meant we had to rush a bit.

So we reconvened [on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/nipafx) a week later and took an hour to present it properly.
[MihÃ¡ly](https://github.com/Michael1993/) and [Simon](https://github.com/aepfli) were there as well - unfortunately, [Matthias](https://github.com/Bukama/) didn't feel well that evening and couldn't make it.

We had a great evening, though, and covered pretty much everything Pioneer there is to talk about.
