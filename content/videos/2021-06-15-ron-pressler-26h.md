## Intro

Hi everyone,

I'm nipafx (but you can call me Nicolai) and today it's gonna be you, me, Ron Pressler, and the state of Project Loom!
Ron Pressler is the lead of Project Loom, which will bring fibers or virtual threads to Java, and during the [26-hour Java live stream](/26h-Java) we spent most of an hour talking about it.

We covered the project's core mission, challenges like interaction with debuggers and garbage collectors, the timeline for the next steps (spoiler: Loom is in final descent!), compatibility with existing code, and a few more things.
Check out the time stamps in the description to jump to what interests you most.

Now, without further ado, let's get it on.

## Outro

Wow, sounds like Project Loom is coming soon-ish.
I really can't wait!

More things people can't wait for: Projects Panama and Valhalla.
On the same stream I also talked to their respective leads, Maurizio Cimadamore and Brian Goetz, and I'll upload those conversations soon.
You know what you should do now, so you don't miss those videos, right?
You click the... yeah, you got it.

I'll see you then, so long!
