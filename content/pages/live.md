## Upcoming

For starters, here are the next two scheduled streams:

<calendar type="streams" time="upcoming" order="asc" limit="2" display="list"></calendar>

For a further look into the future, check [the full schedule](schedule).

## Topics

Here's what you can expect to see on stream.

### Exploring Java

One of the things I'm most interested in are new Java features.
Be it language, API, or JVM improvements, I'm always curious to dig into them and I often do that on stream.

### JUnit Pioneer

At least twice a month, I work on [JUnit Pioneer](https://junit-pioneer.org), a JUnit 5 extension pack.
It's full-on project maintenance, from working through issues to reviewing pull requests to configuring infrastructure.
Of course there's a lot of coding as well when existing extensions get, err, extended or new ones are created from scratch.

### Gatsby and nipafx.dev

I've built this site with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), parts of it on stream, and I've got [plenty of ideas](https://github.com/nipafx/nipafx.dev/issues) for how to improve it further.
Much of that will also happen on stream.
Expect tinkering with React, JSX, HTML, and CSS.

### Games

I occasionally play games and I'll definitely play _Cyberpunk 2077_!
And sometimes we play together - Stellaris for example, or Pandemic (with an actual board!).

### Guests

Occasionally, there are guests.
I had [Oliver Drotbohm over for a conversation about modularity in Java](oliver-drotbohm-modularity), [Maurice Naftalin](https://twitter.com/mauricenaftalin) to discuss recent Java developments, [Sadiq Jaffer](https://twitter.com/sadiqj) to dig into helpful NPE stack reconstruction, and a few more.
Is there anybody whose opinion on a Java topic you're interested in?
Let me know, maybe we can make it happen.
