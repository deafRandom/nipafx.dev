Yes, 26 hours of Java!
There will be technical deep dives, interviews, conversations, and lots of code!
Most importantly, it will be a lot of fun and I hope you join us on that fine Saturday in May.


## Time

Same time like [last year](25h-java) (but an hour longer of course!):

*   where Java was born: **11 PM (28th) to 1 AM (30th) PDT**
*   where the clock lives: **0600 (29th) to 0800 (30th) UTC**
*   where I live: **0800 (29th) to 1000 (30th) CEST**


## Locations

This year, I won't be doing it alone (we're all getting old, even the Mona Lisa is falling apart).
Instead, there are a few other cool Java streamers who will take over some of those 26 hours:

* Sebastien Blanc [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/sebi2706)
* Billy Korando [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e2wwQgFc2E)
* Ted M. Young [on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/jitterted)
* yours truly [on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/nipafx)

Think of this as a relay race - each of us will stream on their own channel and hand over the baton to the next when the time comes.


## Timeline

Here's what we plan to dissect and discuss with you.
We will have a few slides, guests, repos, and a rough idea where we're going, but the cool thing about a stream is that you're there with us, so you can ask questions, decide what to emphasize, and tell us where to go next.
